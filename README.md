# dsa-java
Java implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms with step-by-step problem solving, organized by topic (Two Pointers, HashMap, Searching, Sorting, Stack, Queue, etc.). Includes Time and Space Complexity Analysis.

# DSA in Java – Pattern-Based Problem Solving

This repository contains my structured practice of Data Structures and
Algorithms using Java, focused on learning and applying common
problem-solving patterns and techniques.

Java fundamentals are already covered in a separate repository.
This repo is dedicated purely to DSA.

## 📌 What This Repository Covers

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search Patterns
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Hashing Techniques
- Stack & Queue Patterns
- Linked List Techniques
- Tree & Binary Tree Problems
- Graph Traversals (BFS / DFS)
- Sorting & Searching Applications
- Dynamic Programming (later stage)

Each folder represents a pattern or data-structure-focused category.
